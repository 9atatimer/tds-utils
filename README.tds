Howdy!

What you're looking at here is the root of Todd's standard
unix environment tree -- this has all the custommizations
he's done to make any unix system he works on 'familiar'.

There are a copy of top-level dirs:
  share --> the platform independent content
  common -> re-used, but platform-conditional, content
  local --> the customizations for this specific unix environemnt
  test ---> unit tests, basically, to ensure things are working.
  bin ----> executable scripts (language depedented, but OS neutral)

Cheers.
