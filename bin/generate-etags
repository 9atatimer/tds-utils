# Generate a tags file, the first step in getting tags to work in emacs.

# Remove the TAGS file 
rm -f TAGS

# Find the file extensions we're looking for and pass them to xargs.
# Use the -0 option for xargs to handle files with spaces in their names.
# xargs seems to work but gives warnings if the -O option isn't used.
#
# Then run etags with these options:
#  --extra=+q         Add entries for classes. Not really pertinent now.
#  --fields=+fksaiS   Specifies which fields are included in the tags file.
#  --c++-kinds=+px    Language specific tags. Not really pertinent now.
#  --append           Indicates whether tags generated from the specified
#                     files  should be  appended  to  those  already present
#                     in the tag file or should replace them. I nuke the file
#                     before regenerating it so it probably is moot.
